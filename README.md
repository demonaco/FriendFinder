# FriendFinder
An Express app to help you find people with similar interests

## Summary:
The Friend Finder app is the go-to app to find your new friend! Answer a survey of ten questions and the backend logic will find a new friend for you. The application is meant to showcase my learning of Express.js, routing, and setting up/using a local server. The app is also an experimentation in discovering what can be accomplished with API data and how objects and array data can be used to accomplish logistical goals.
